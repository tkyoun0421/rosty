# WORKLOG

## Current Task

Implement the current `Scheduling / Staffing 개선` lane after the cancellation queue search slice.

## Plan Doc

- Master plan: `docs/development-plan.md`

## Last Completed

Completed the `Scheduling / Staffing 개선 -> Cancellation Queue local search` slice:

- Added local search matching for requester, schedule, position, and reason in the cancellation queue.
- Updated `src/features/assignments/ui/cancellation-queue-screen.tsx` with a queue search field on top of the existing tabs and review chips.
- Updated the master plan so the scheduling/staffing lane reflects the shipped queue search slice.

## Next Action

Lock the next `ready` item under `Scheduling / Staffing 개선`, starting with the next highest-friction operator workflow.

## Blockers

- The shared scheduling/payroll read migration is repo-tracked but not yet applied to the real Supabase project, so assignments and payroll routes will still show the seeded fallback there.
- The new settings migrations are also not yet applied to the real Supabase project, so live self profile updates and Settings deactivation cannot work there yet.
- The member-directory search migration is also not yet applied to the real Supabase project, so live manager/admin member search cannot work there yet.
- The new availability migration is also not yet applied to the real Supabase project, so the live employee availability RPC cannot work there yet.
- The new confirm-schedule migration is also not yet applied to the real Supabase project, so the live assignment workspace confirm RPC cannot work there yet.
- The new cancellation-request migration is also not yet applied to the real Supabase project, so the live employee cancellation RPC cannot work there yet.
- The new cancellation-review migration is also not yet applied to the real Supabase project, so the live manager/admin queue review RPC cannot work there yet.
- The new notifications migrations are also not yet applied to the real Supabase project, so the live inbox cannot receive the new cancellation, assignment-confirmed, schedule-created, or user-approved notifications there yet.
- The new schedule-completion migration is also not yet applied to the real Supabase project, so the live assigned-to-completed closeout path cannot work there yet.
- The new schedule-cancellation migration is also not yet applied to the real Supabase project, so the live collecting-or-assigned cancellation path cannot work there yet.
- Real Google OAuth still needs manual device or emulator confirmation on a dev build or standalone app.
- The real project still has no persistent admin account because this session does not yet have the intended target auth user email or UUID for the bootstrap command.
- The fetched legacy single-hall tables remain in the remote project until a later cleanup task is explicitly locked.
- Push delivery and device-token registration are still unimplemented.

## Latest Verification

- `corepack pnpm lint`
- `corepack pnpm typecheck`
